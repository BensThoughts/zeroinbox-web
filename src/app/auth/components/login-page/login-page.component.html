          This app is in heavy beta development. The site will be up and down during
          this time.  It will also be in a read-only mode, so no actual changes to your
          inbox will occur.  Still if you stumble across this page in the wild and it 
          happens to let you login.  You can get some insights into your Gmail inbox. 
          
          Zero Inbox is an attachment to for the Gmail inbox. It will give you suggestions
          for actions that you can select to take on your inbox. You can also create and 
          manage new actions and filters that it has yet to suggest.
