          The first time you ever use the app the contents of your inbox will be downloaded to our servers
        </li>
        <li>
          This process can take 3 or 4 minutes on larger inboxes and may not even show up on very small ones
        </li>

          Feel free to explore other parts of the website while this occurs

            As soon as the inbox is completely downloaded you will be taken to a homepage that

            Feel free to come back to these stats later as you clean up to see how they have changed
